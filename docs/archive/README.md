## Current Documentation

For current, actively maintained documentation, see:

- **Operations**: [../operations/](../operations/) - Deployment, runbooks, troubleshooting
- **Development**: [../development/](../development/) - Developer guides, examples, standards
- **Reference**: [../reference/](../reference/) - Technical specifications and schemas

## Why Archive?

These documents are preserved because they:

1. **Historical Context** - Show the evolution of design decisions
2. **Reference Value** - May contain useful insights for future work
3. **Completeness** - Maintain a complete project history

## Note

The information in archived documents may be outdated or superseded by current implementation. Always refer to the current documentation in the parent directories for accurate, up-to-date information.
